# Calculator

## 1. **Functions**: 
   - The code defines functions for basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, square root, and percentage.
   
## 2. **User Input**: 
   - The user enters two numbers and chooses an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `sqrt`, `%`).

## 3. **`match-case` Block**: 
   - Based on the operation input, the `match-case` block runs the appropriate function.
   - Special cases handle errors, like division by zero or trying to calculate the square root of a negative number.

## 4. **Output**: 
   - The result of the operation is printed, or an error message is shown if the operation is invalid.

## Summary
The code takes user input for numbers and a math operation, performs the calculation using a `match-case`, and prints the result or handles errors.
