# Distance Converter

This code performs unit conversions between different length measurements. Here’s a brief breakdown:

## 1. **`convert` Function**: 
   - Takes three parameters: `value` (the amount to convert), `from_unit` (the current unit), and `to_unit` (the target unit).
   - Uses a dictionary called `conversions` to define conversion factors between various units.
   - Converts the input `value` from `from_unit` to `to_unit` by multiplying it by the appropriate conversion factor and rounds the result to two decimal places.

## 2. **Conversion Menu**:
   - Displays a menu for selecting units.
   - Prompts the user to choose units and input the value to convert.
   - Uses the `convert` function to compute and display the result.

## 3. **Error Handling**:
   - Checks if the user inputs valid unit numbers and values.
   - Handles invalid inputs with a `ValueError`.

## 4. **Loop**:
   - Continuously prompts the user to perform another conversion until they decide to stop.

## Summary
Overall, it’s a simple unit converter for length measurements with user interaction for dynamic conversions.
